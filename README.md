# ðŸš€ Space_Missions_Analysis
Analyzing Space Mission over a period of time. 
This dataset was scraped from nextspaceflight.com and includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race between the USA and the Soviet Union in 1957!

This project explores global space missions data to understand the evolution of space programs, key organizations, country-wise performance, and launch successes and failures over time. The analysis spans from the Cold War era to modern private space companies like SpaceX.

Key Insights:

1. USA vs USSR Dominance
During the Cold War era, the USA and USSR (including Russia and Kazakhstan) were dominant players in space launches, accounting for thousands of missions.

After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, the USA maintained steady space activity, while Russia's dominance slightly declined.

Launch Share (Cold War Era): 69.9% USSR, 30.1% USA.

2. Number of Launches Over Time
Space launches peaked in the early 1980s, particularly between 1980 and 1984.

A significant drop in launches occurred in the late 1990s, likely due to economic constraints and reductions following the Cold War.

A renewed surge in launches occurred after 2010, largely driven by private companies such as SpaceX.

3. Most Active Months for Launches
November consistently sees the highest number of launches, likely due to favorable weather conditions and mission planning cycles.

May and June show the lowest number of launches, possibly due to adverse weather and scheduling conflicts.

4. Launch Price Trends
The launch price peaked in 1970 at $1,150 million, reflecting the ambitious Apollo program and other high-cost missions.

Post-1975, launch costs dropped significantly due to advancements in technology, leading to more cost-effective and efficient launches.

5. Mission Failures Over Time
Early space missions (1960s-1980s) had higher failure rates.

Over time, the failure rate decreased significantly, indicating technological improvements and better planning in mission execution.

Mission Success Rate: 91.62% successful, 8.38% failed. Partial and prelaunch failures account for 1.78% of total missions.

6. Dominant Organizations Over the Years
During the 1970sâ€“1980s, NASA and Soviet space agencies (e.g., RKA) were the most prominent players in space launches.

From 2018â€“2020, private companies like SpaceX became the dominant force in space missions, reflecting the rise of private space exploration.

7. Failure Percentage by Country
Historically, Russia (including Kazakhstan) has had a higher failure rate, possibly due to a larger number of experimental missions.

Although both the USSR and the USA experienced high failure rates in the early years, the USA has shown more consistent success in recent decades.

8. Country with Most Launches per Year
The USA led space launches in the late 1990s to the 2020s.

During the Cold War, the USSR had more launches.

Other countries have started contributing to space missions, but the USA and Russia still dominate the launch landscape.

9. Highest Launches by Year
The year with the highest number of launches is 2024, marking a significant milestone in space exploration.

10. Highest Launches by Month
The month with the highest number of launches is November 2024, with 32 launches recorded.

December is the most active month historically with 748 launches.

January shows the least activity, with only 434 launches.
